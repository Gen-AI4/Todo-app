# Specification Quality Checklist: Chat UI Responsiveness & Modern Polish

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker remains in User Story 5 regarding backend tool execution metadata availability. This is a critical clarification that impacts whether tool-specific feedback uses real backend signals or client-side heuristics.
- Content Quality note: FR-007/FR-008 reference `prefers-color-scheme` (a CSS standard, not an implementation detail) and Assumptions mention Tailwind — these are constraints from the user, not leaked implementation details.
